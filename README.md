# ðŸ“± Damn-Vulnerable-Bank Guide  

A guide to setting up **Damn-Vulnerable-Bank (DVBA)** for mobile penetration testing.

## ðŸš€ Why DVBA?  

I know it's hard to find the right app to practice **mobile pentesting**.  
For web security, you have **DVWA, bWAPP, WebGoat**, and many othersâ€”easy to deploy with plenty of documentation.  

But for **mobile apps**, it's a different story. **Documentation is scarce**, and setting up DVBA can be tricky.  
That's why I created this guideâ€”to make your life easier! ðŸ˜Š
